Developing novel approaches to leverage the power of deep learning in low-data scenarios is sparking great attention, and future developments are expected to propel the field further. This mini-review provides an overview of recent low-data-learning approaches in drug discovery, analyzing their hurdles and advantages.

In small molecule drug discovery, such methods inform high-stakes decisions like compound synthesis and in-vivo studies. This application lies at the intersection of multiple scientific disciplines. When comparing new ML methods to baseline or state-of-the-art approaches, statistically rigorous method comparison protocols and domain-appropriate performance metrics are essential to ensure replicability and ultimately the adoption of ML in small molecule drug discovery. This paper proposes a set of guidelines to incentivize rigorous and domain-appropriate techniques for method comparison tailored to small molecule property modeling. These guidelines, accompanied by annotated examples and open-source software tools, lay a foundation for robust ML benchmarking and thus the development of more impactful methods.},

	abstract = {The SAMPL series of challenges aim to focus the community on specific modeling challenges, while testing and hopefully driving progress of computational methods to help guide pharmaceutical drug discovery. In this study, we report on the results of the SAMPL8 host–guest blind challenge for predicting absolute binding affinities. SAMPL8 focused on two host–guest datasets, one involving the cucurbituril CB8 (with a series of common drugs of abuse) and another involving two different Gibb deep-cavity cavitands. The latter dataset involved a previously featured deep cavity cavitand (TEMOA) as well as a new variant (TEETOA), both binding to a series of relatively rigid fragment-like guests. Challenge participants employed a reasonably wide variety of methods, though many of these were based on molecular simulations, and predictive accuracy was mixed. As in some previous SAMPL iterations (SAMPL6 and SAMPL7), we found that one approach to achieve greater accuracy was to apply empirical corrections to the binding free energy predictions, taking advantage of prior data on binding to these hosts. Another approach which performed well was a hybrid MD-based approach with reweighting to a force matched QM potential. In the cavitand challenge, an alchemical method using the AMOEBA-polarizable force field achieved the best success with RMSE less than 1 kcal/mol, while another alchemical approach (ATM/GAFF2-AM1BCC/TIP3P/HREM) had RMSE less than 1.75 kcal/mol. The work discussed here also highlights several important lessons; for example, retrospective studies of reference calculations demonstrate the sensitivity of predicted binding free energies to ethyl group sampling and/or guest starting pose, providing guidance to help improve future studies on these systems.},

	abstract = {A novel crystallographic fragment screening data set was generated and used in the SAMPL7 challenge for protein-ligands. The SAMPL challenges prospectively assess the predictive power of methods involved in computer-aided drug design. Application of various methods to fragment molecules are now widely used in the search for new drugs. However, there is little in the way of systematic validation specifically for fragment-based approaches. We have performed a large crystallographic high-throughput fragment screen against the therapeutically relevant second bromodomain of the Pleckstrin-homology domain interacting protein (PHIP2) that revealed 52 different fragments bound across 4 distinct sites, 47 of which were bound to the pharmacologically relevant acetylated lysine (Kac) binding site. These data were used to assess computational screening, binding pose prediction and follow-up enumeration. All submissions performed randomly for screening. Pose prediction success rates (defined as less than 2 Å root mean squared deviation against heavy atom crystal positions) ranged between 0 and 25\% and only a very few follow-up compounds were deemed viable candidates from a medicinal-chemistry perspective based on a common molecular descriptors analysis. The tight deadlines imposed during the challenge led to a small number of submissions suggesting that the accuracy of rapidly responsive workflows remains limited. In addition, the application of these methods to reproduce crystallographic fragment data still appears to be very challenging. The results show that there is room for improvement in the development of computational tools particularly when applied to fragment-based drug design.},

	abstract = {Accurately predicting the binding affinities of small organic molecules to biological macro-molecules can greatly accelerate drug discovery by reducing the number of compounds that must be synthesized to realize desired potency and selectivity goals. Unfortunately, the process of assessing the accuracy of current computational approaches to affinity prediction against binding data to biological macro-molecules is frustrated by several challenges, such as slow conformational dynamics, multiple titratable groups, and the lack of high-quality blinded datasets. Over the last several SAMPL blind challenge exercises, host-guest systems have emerged as a practical and effective way to circumvent these challenges in assessing the predictive performance of current-generation quantitative modeling tools, while still providing systems capable of possessing tight binding affinities. Here, we present an overview of the SAMPL6 host-guest binding affinity prediction challenge, which featured three supramolecular hosts: octa-acid (OA), the closely related tetra-endo-methyl-octa-acid (TEMOA), and cucurbit[]uril (CB8), along with 21 small organic guest molecules. A total of 119 entries were received from 10 participating groups employing a variety of methods that spanned from electronic structure and movable type calculations in implicit solvent to alchemical and potential of mean force strategies using empirical force fields with explicit solvent models. While empirical models tended to obtain better performance than first-principle methods, it was not possible to identify a single approach that consistently provided superior results across all host-guest systems and statistical metrics. Moreover, the accuracy of the methodologies generally displayed a substantial dependence on the system considered, emphasizing the need for host diversity in blind evaluations. Several entries exploited previous experimental measurements of similar host-guest systems in an effort to improve their physical-based predictions via some manner of rudimentary machine learning; while this strategy succeeded in reducing systematic errors, it did not correspond to an improvement in statistical correlation. Comparison to previous rounds of the host-guest binding free energy challenge highlights an overall improvement in the correlation obtained by the affinity predictions for OA and TEMOA systems, but a surprising lack of improvement regarding root mean square error over the past several challenge rounds. The data suggests that further refinement of force field parameters, as well as improved treatment of chemical effects (e.g., buffer salt conditions, protonation states) may be required to further enhance predictive accuracy.},

	abstract = {We report the results of the SAMPL9 host–guest blind challenge for predicting binding free energies. The challenge focused on macrocycles from pillar[n]-arene and cyclodextrin host families, including WP6, and bCD and HbCD. A variety of methods were used by participants to submit binding free energy predictions. A machine learning approach based on molecular descriptors achieved the highest accuracy (RMSE of 2.04 kcal mol−1) among the ranked methods in the WP6 dataset. Interestingly, predictions for WP6 obtained via docking tended to outperform all methods (RMSE of 1.70 kcal mol−1), most of which are MD based and computationally more expensive. In general, methods applying force fields achieved better correlation with experiments for WP6 opposed to the machine learning and docking models. In the cyclodextrin-phenothiazine challenge, the ATM approach emerged as the top performing method with RMSE less than 1.86 kcal mol−1. Correlation metrics of ranked methods in this dataset were relatively poor compared to WP6. We also highlight several lessons learned to guide future work and help improve studies on the systems discussed. For example, WP6 may be present in other microstates other than its −12 state in the presence of certain guests. Machine learning approaches can be used to fine tune or help train force fields for certain chemistry (i.e. WP6-G4). Certain phenothiazines occupy distinct primary and secondary orientations, some of which were considered individually for accurate binding free energies. The accuracy of predictions from certain methods while starting from a single binding pose/orientation demonstrates the sensitivity of calculated binding free energies to the orientation, and in some cases the likely dominant orientation for the system. Computational and experimental results suggest that guest phenothiazine core traverses both the secondary and primary faces of the cyclodextrin hosts, a bulky cationic side chain will primarily occupy the primary face, and the phenothiazine core substituent resides at the larger secondary face.},

In this sense, the results represent a solution to the classical protein folding problem, at least for single proteins. The models have already been shown to be capable of providing solutions for problematic crystal structures, and there are broad implications for the rest of structural biology. Other research groups also substantially improved performance. Here we describe these results and outline some of the many implications.

	abstract = {Computing protein structure from amino acid sequence information has been a long-standing grand challenge. Critical assessment of structure prediction (CASP) conducts community experiments aimed at advancing solutions to this and related problems. Experiments are conducted every 2 years. The 2020 experiment (CASP14) saw major progress, with the second generation of deep learning methods delivering accuracy comparable with experiment for many single proteins. There is an expectation that these methods will have much wider application in computational structural biology. Here we summarize results from the most recent experiment, CASP15, in 2022, with an emphasis on new deep learning-driven progress. Other papers in this special issue of proteins provide more detailed analysis. For single protein structures, the AlphaFold2 deep learning method is still superior to other approaches, but there are two points of note. First, although AlphaFold2 was the core of all the most successful methods, there was a wide variety of implementation and combination with other methods. Second, using the standard AlphaFold2 protocol and default parameters only produces the highest quality result for about two thirds of the targets, and more extensive sampling is required for the others. The major advance in this CASP is the enormous increase in the accuracy of computed protein complexes, achieved by the use of deep learning methods, although overall these do not fully match the performance for single proteins. Here too, AlphaFold2 based method perform best, and again more extensive sampling than the defaults is often required. Also of note are the encouraging early results on the use of deep learning to compute ensembles of macromolecular structures. Critically for the usability of computed structures, for both single proteins and protein complexes, deep learning derived estimates of both local and global accuracy are of high quality, however the estimates in interface regions are slightly less reliable. CASP15 also included computation of RNA structures for the first time. Here, the classical approaches produced better agreement with experiment than the new deep learning ones, and accuracy is limited. Also, for the first time, CASP included the computation of protein-ligand complexes, an area of special interest for drug design. Here too, classical methods were still superior to deep learning ones. Many new approaches were discussed at the CASP conference, and it is clear methods will continue to advance.},

The most recent experiment (CASP13 held in 2018) saw dramatic progress in structure modeling without use of structural templates (historically "ab initio" modeling). Progress was driven by the successful application of deep learning techniques to predict inter-residue distances. In turn, these results drove dramatic improvements in three-dimensional structure accuracy: With the proviso that there are an adequate number of sequences known for the protein family, the new methods essentially solve the long-standing problem of predicting the fold topology of monomeric proteins. Further, the number of sequences required in the alignment has fallen substantially. There is also substantial improvement in the accuracy of template-based models. Other areas-model refinement, accuracy estimation, and the structure of protein assemblies-have again yielded interesting results. CASP13 placed increased emphasis on the use of sparse data together with modeling and chemical crosslinking, SAXS, and NMR all yielded more mature results. This paper summarizes the key outcomes of CASP13. The special issue of PROTEINS contains papers describing the CASP13 assessments in each modeling category and contributions from the participants.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach to structure-based drug design (POSIT) rigorously built on the simple concept that pose prediction is intimately coupled to the quality and availability of experimental structural data. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by performing retrospective analyses on three data sets designed to explore the strengths and weaknesses of POSIT relative to existing methods. We then present results documenting 2.5 years of prospective use of POSIT across a variety of structure-based industrial drug-discovery research projects. We find that POSIT is well-suited to guiding research decision making for structure-based design and, in particular, excels at enabling lead-optimization campaigns. We show that the POSIT framework can drive superior pose-prediction performance and generate results that naturally lend themselves to prospective decision making during lead optimization. We believe the results presented here are (1) the largest prospective validation of a pose prediction method reported to date (71 crystal structures); (2) provide an unprecedented look at the scope of impact of a computational tool; and (3) represent a first-of-its-kind analysis. We hope that this work inspires additional studies that look at the real impact and performance of computational research tools on prospective drug design.},

Molecular docking is an in silico technique that predicts the bound 3D conformations of two molecules, a necessary step for other structure-based methods. Here, we describe version 1.3 of the open-source molecular docking software Gnina. This release updates the underlying deep learning framework to PyTorch, resulting in more computationally efficient docking and paving the way for seamless integration of other deep learning methods into the docking pipeline. We retrained our CNN scoring functions on the updated CrossDocked2020 v1.3 dataset and introduce knowledge-distilled CNN scoring functions to facilitate high-throughput virtual screening with Gnina. Furthermore, we add functionality for covalent docking, where an atom of the ligand is covalently bound to an atom of the receptor. This update expands the scope of docking with Gnina and further positions Gnina as a user-friendly, open-source molecular docking framework. Gnina is available at https://github.com/gnina/gnina.},

While recent advances, such as AlphaFold3 and Boltz-1, have substantially improved our ability to predict biomolecular complex structures, these models still fall short in predicting binding affinity, a critical property underlying molecular function and therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present Boltz-2, a new structural biology foundation model that exhibits strong performance for both structure and affinity prediction. Boltz-2 introduces controllability features including experimental method conditioning, distance constraints, and multi-chain template integration for structure prediction, and is, to our knowledge, the first AI model to approach the performance of free-energy perturbation (FEP) methods in estimating small molecule–protein binding affinity. Crucially, it achieves strong correlation with experimental readouts on many benchmarks, while being at least 1000× more computationally efficient than FEP. By coupling Boltz-2 with a generative model for small molecules, we demonstrate an effective workflow to find diverse, synthesizable, high-affinity binders, as estimated by absolute FEP simulations on the TYK2 target. To foster broad adoption and further innovation at the intersection of machine learning and biology, we are releasing Boltz-2 weights, inference, and training code 1 under a permissive open license, providing a robust and extensible foundation for both academic and industrial research.},

Among techniques for predicting relative binding affinities, the most consistently accurate is free energy perturbation (FEP), a class of rigorous physics-based methods. However, uncertainty remains about how accurate FEP is and can ever be. Here, we present what we believe to be the largest publicly available dataset of proteins and congeneric series of small molecules, and assess the accuracy of the leading FEP workflow. To ascertain the limit of achievable accuracy, we also survey the reproducibility of experimental relative affinity measurements. We find a wide variability in experimental accuracy and a correspondence between binding and functional assays. When careful preparation of protein and ligand structures is undertaken, FEP can achieve accuracy comparable to experimental reproducibility. Throughout, we highlight reliable protocols that can help maximize the accuracy of FEP in prospective studies.},

However, for many properties, public and private training sets are typically small, making it difficult for models to generalize well outside of the training data. Recently, this lack of generalization has been mitigated by using self-supervised pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, followed by finetuning on smaller, labeled datasets. Inspired by these advances, we report MolE, a Transformer architecture adapted for molecular graphs together with a two-step pretraining strategy. The first step of pretraining is a self-supervised approach focused on learning chemical structures trained on {\textasciitilde}842 million molecular graphs, and the second step is a massive multi-task approach to learn biological information. We show that finetuning models that were pretrained in this way perform better than the best published results on 10 of the 22 ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) tasks included in the Therapeutic Data Commons leaderboard (c. September 2023).},

We find that good quality AI-based support of clinical decision-making improves diagnostic accuracy over that of either AI or physicians alone, and that the least experienced clinicians gain the most from AI-based support. We further find that AI-based multiclass probabilities outperformed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) representations of AI in the mobile technology environment, and AI-based support had utility in simulations of second opinions and of telemedicine triage. In addition to demonstrating the potential benefits associated with good quality AI in the hands of non-expert clinicians, we find that faulty AI can mislead the entire spectrum of clinicians, including experts. Lastly, we show that insights derived from AI class-activation maps can inform improvements in human diagnosis. Together, our approach and findings offer a framework for future studies across the spectrum of image-based diagnostics to improve human–computer collaboration in clinical practice.},

We strongly believe that a limiting factor is the lack of a widely accepted and established community benchmarking process that independently assesses the performance and drives the development of methods, similar to the CASP benchmarking challenge for protein structure prediction. Here, we provide an overview of P-AP, unblinded benchmarking data sets, and blinded benchmarking initiatives (concluded and ongoing) and offer a perspective on learnings and the future of the field. To accelerate a breakthrough on the development of novel P-AP methods, it is necessary for the community to establish and support a long-term benchmark challenge that provides nonbiased training/test/validation sets, a systematic independent validation, and a forum for scientific discussions.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has driven major breakthroughs in protein structure prediction, however the next critical advance is accurately predicting how proteins interact with other molecules, especially small molecule ligands, to enable real-world applications such as drug discovery and design. Recent deep learning all-atom methods have been built to address this challenge, but evaluating their performance on the prediction of protein-ligand complexes has been inconclusive due to the lack of relevant benchmarking datasets. Here we present a comprehensive evaluation of four leading all-atom cofolding deep learning methods using our newly introduced benchmark dataset Runs N’ Poses, which comprises 2,600 high-resolution protein-ligand systems released after the training cutoff used by these methods. We demonstrate that current co-folding approaches largely memorise ligand poses from their training data, hindering their use for de novo drug design. This limitation is especially pronounced for ligands that have only been seen binding in one pocket, whereas more promiscuous ligands such as cofactors show moderately improved performance. With this work and benchmark dataset, we aim to accelerate progress in the field by allowing for a more realistic assessment of the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Our resulting best hit series tied for first place when evaluated by a panel of expert judges. Here, we report our top-performing open-source workflow and results.},

	abstract = {There is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data. A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
